                <p>The University of Notre Dame's Band of the Fighting Irish, founded in 1845, is the oldest university marching band in continuous existence in the United States. Originally formed to provide military drills and parades, it has evolved into one of the most recognizable college bands in the country.</p>
                
                <p>In 1907, the University of Illinois Marching Illini introduced the first-ever halftime show at a college football game, forever changing the role of marching bands from mere musical accompaniment to headline attractions that captivate stadium audiences.</p>
                
                <p>These two historic programs laid the groundwork for the modern marching band, uniting music, movement, and school pride into an American art form that continues to inspire generations of students and fans across the nation.</p>
