        <p>A.J. Neubert’s Accoladi.com profile quickly attracted the attention of numerous collegiate fine arts recruiters in late 2018 and early 2019. They were specifically looking for accomplished bassoon players like A.J., who had numerous accolades such as All-State honors, concerto contest wins, and prestigious summer music experiences. Additionally, they evaluated his performance repertoire, particularly those rated or competed, and A.J. excelled in all these areas.</p>
        <p>With growing interest from recruiters, A.J. and his family meticulously researched the scholarship potential of his selected institutions, both institutional and external. With valuable input from his band director and private bassoon instructor, A.J. narrowed his choices to five schools.</p>
        <p>He auditioned at all five, receiving acceptance from each. However, it was Oberlin College & Conservatory in Ohio that not only accepted him but also awarded a full four-year tuition and fees scholarship, totaling $334,358 for his undergraduate degree in performance.</p>
