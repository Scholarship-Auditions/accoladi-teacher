      <p class="testimonial-text">
        Despite having a strong musical résumé, A.J. struggled to find college
        opportunities that matched his talent and aspirations. That's when
        Accoladi stepped in, opening doors he never thought possible.
      </p>
      <p class="testimonial-text">
        Through our platform, A.J. discovered scholarships, connected with
        prestigious institutions like Oberlin Conservatory and the Colburn
        School, and received invaluable guidance throughout his application
        process.
      </p>
      <p class="testimonial-text">
        Today, A.J. serves as Principal Bassoonist with the Charlotte Symphony,
        living proof that with the right support, dreams do come true. And for
        him, Accoladi helped make that possible.
