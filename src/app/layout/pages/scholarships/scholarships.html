                    Non-institutional scholarships—those offered by private organizations, foundations, businesses, religious groups, and civic associations—can be a valuable source of funding for students. Unlike institutional aid, which comes directly from colleges or universities, these scholarships are awarded independently and can often be used at a variety of accredited schools, giving students more flexibility and additional support to offset the cost of higher education.
