          Non-institutional scholarships—those offered by private organizations,
          foundations, businesses, religious groups, and civic associations—can
          be a valuable source of funding for students. Unlike institutional
          aid, which comes directly from colleges or universities, these
          scholarships are awarded independently and can often be used at a
          variety of accredited schools, giving students more flexibility and
          additional support to offset the cost of higher education.

            Performing Arts Scholarships: The Untold Story of Unrestricted
            Funding
          </h3>
          <p class="article-description">
            Although college sports often steal the spotlight, performing arts
            students have access to significantly more scholarship funding—over
            $5 billion annually—due to fewer restrictions on where their
            scholarships can come from. Unlike athletes who are bound by NCAA
            rules, performing arts students can receive both institutional and
            third-party scholarships throughout their education.

            Religious scholarships are a powerful yet often overlooked source of
            college funding, available to students active in faith communities

            educators through college.
