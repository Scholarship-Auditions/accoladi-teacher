                    <p>Musical terms are woven into every part of your audition journey. They appear on entrance exams,
                        guide your sightreading, shape your solo interpretation, and may even be part of your solo’s
                        title. That’s why a confident understanding of musical terminology isn’t just helpful—it’s
                        essential.</p>

                    <p>To create the Accoladi Musical Terms Directory, our research team reviewed more than 500 music
                        school entrance exams, 100 sightreading excerpts, and hundreds of required solos and orchestral
                        excerpts. From this comprehensive analysis, we identified 470 core musical terms.</p>

                    <p>Each term in this directory has been categorized into five levels of difficulty, based on how
                        frequently they appear and the selectivity of the institutions that use them. Whether you're
                        just starting out or preparing for a conservatory audition, this tool helps you focus your study
                        and speak the universal language of music with confidence.</p>

                <p>At a university audition in Texas, a professor asked a surprising question:</p>
                <p class="quote">“What musical term best describes you as a person?”</p>

                <p>The student paused, then answered:</p>
                <p class="quote">“Sforzando — because I attack every opportunity with force.”</p>

                <p>That one word made him unforgettable.</p>
